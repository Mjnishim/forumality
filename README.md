#### Forumality

A toy project for trying out technologies/approaches I haven't used professionally, but are at least somewhat adjacent, because more options broadens perspectives.

Presently thinking of doing a forum-like; it's a solved problem in practical technologies, and the end result will probably be both overengineered and inefficient compared to just installing PHPBB somewhere, but it's a decent enough example to implement business logic for. 

Aiming at:

- Postgres (Replacing MySQL)
- Prisma (Replacing Knex/Objection, TS-first)
- NextJS (Replacing Vite/Webpack/react-router)
- Zod
- Minikube/Kustomize (replacing Helm)
- Playwright (replacing Cypress)
- Vitest / RTL (alternative... Mocha?)
- @bbob/react (?? Look, if I'm doing a forum, BBCode is mandatory)
